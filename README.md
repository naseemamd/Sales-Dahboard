The Sales Analysis project with Year-over-Year Comparison utilizes Tableau to analyze sales performance across different products, regions, or business segments and compares the results to the previous year's performance. This project aims to provide stakeholders with actionable insights into sales trends, identify areas of growth or decline, and facilitate data-driven decision-making.
